# DSA/TOC Tool

The goal of this project is to provide an educational tool to learn/practice CS topics surrounding
data structures, algorithms, and the theory of computation. 

### Tests

* To write tests, you can add test files to `test/`, or modify the existing tests. 

### TODO

This project is in infancy, so there is still a lot to contribute. Here are some things off of the top of my head:

 * Automated testing, which automatically executes all of the files in the `test/` folder
 * Methods to read `.txt` files which can generate and perform operations on DFAs, NFAs, and be validated by a Regex
 * Methods to read `.txt` files which can generate and perform operations on PDAs, CFGs, and convert CFGs to CNF. 
 * Methods to set up and simulate a Turing Machine by utlizing the API for tape reads/writes as well as moving up and down the tape. 

 ### Naming convention

 Private fields should use `snake_case`
 Variables which are local to a function or otherwise exist temporarily should use `camelCase`
 Class member functions should use `camelCase`, per Java convention.
